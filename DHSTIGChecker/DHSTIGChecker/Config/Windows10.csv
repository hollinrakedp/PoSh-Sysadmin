Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication.

Factors include: 

1) Something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN);

2) Something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); and

3) Something a user is (e.g., biometric).

A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user.

Network access is defined as access to an information system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, or the Internet).

Local access is defined as access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a direct connection without the use of a network.

The DoD CAC with DoD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor authentication.

Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior.

Enabling PowerShell Transcription will record detailed information from the processing of PowerShell commands and scripts. This can provide additional detail when malware has run on a system.","If the following registry value does not exist or is not configured as specified, this is a finding.
