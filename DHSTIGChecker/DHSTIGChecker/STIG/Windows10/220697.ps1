Rule Title: Domain-joined systems must use Windows 10 Enterprise Edition 64-bit version.
Severity: medium
Vuln ID: V-220697
STIG ID: WN10-00-000005

Discussion:
Features such as Credential Guard use virtualization based security to protect information that could be used in credential theft attacks if compromised. There are a number of system requirements that must be met in order for Credential Guard to be configured and enabled properly. Virtualization based security and Credential Guard are only available with Windows 10 Enterprise 64-bit version.
