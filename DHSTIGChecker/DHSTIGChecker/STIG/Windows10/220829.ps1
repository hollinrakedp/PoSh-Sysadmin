Rule Title: Autoplay must be disabled for all drives.
Severity: high
Vuln ID: V-220829
STIG ID: WN10-CC-000190

Discussion:
Allowing autoplay to execute may introduce malicious code to a system.  Autoplay begins reading from a drive as soon as you insert media in the drive.  As a result, the setup file of programs or music on audio media may start.  By default, autoplay is disabled on removable drives, such as the floppy disk drive (but not the CD-ROM drive) and on network drives.  If you enable this policy, you can also disable autoplay on all drives.
