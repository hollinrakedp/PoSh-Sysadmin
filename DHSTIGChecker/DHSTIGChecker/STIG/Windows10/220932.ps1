Rule Title: Anonymous access to Named Pipes and Shares must be restricted.
Severity: high
Vuln ID: V-220932
STIG ID: WN10-SO-000165

Discussion:
Allowing anonymous access to named pipes or shares provides the potential for unauthorized system access.  This setting restricts access to those defined in "Network access: Named Pipes that can be accessed anonymously" and "Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously",  both of which must be blank under other requirements.
