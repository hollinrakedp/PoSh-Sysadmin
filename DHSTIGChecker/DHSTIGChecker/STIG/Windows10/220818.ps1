Rule Title: Systems must at least attempt device authentication using certificates.
Severity: medium
Vuln ID: V-220818
STIG ID: WN10-CC-000115

Discussion:
Using certificates to authenticate devices to the domain provides increased security over passwords.  By default systems will attempt to authenticate using certificates and fall back to passwords if the domain controller does not support certificates for devices.  This may also be configured to always use certificates for device authentication.
