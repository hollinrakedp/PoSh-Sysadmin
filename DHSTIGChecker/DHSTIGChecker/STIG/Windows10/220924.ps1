Rule Title: The Smart Card removal option must be configured to Force Logoff or Lock Workstation.
Severity: medium
Vuln ID: V-220924
STIG ID: WN10-SO-000095

Discussion:
Unattended systems are susceptible to unauthorized use and must be locked.  Configuring a system to lock when a smart card is removed will ensure the system is inaccessible when unattended.


Check Content:
If the following registry value does not exist or is not configured as specified, this is a finding:

Registry Hive:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Registry Path:  \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\

Value Name:  SCRemoveOption

Value Type:  REG_SZ
Value:  1 (Lock Workstation) or 2 (Force Logoff)

This can be left not configured or set to "No action" on workstations with the following conditions.  This must be documented with the ISSO.
-The setting cannot be configured due to mission needs, or because it interferes with applications.
-Policy must be in place that users manually lock workstations when leaving them unattended.
-The screen saver is properly configured to lock as required.
