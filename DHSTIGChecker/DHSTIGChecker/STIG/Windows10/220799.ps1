Rule Title: Local administrator accounts must have their privileged token filtered to prevent elevated privileges from being used over the network on domain systems.
Severity: medium
Vuln ID: V-220799
STIG ID: WN10-CC-000037

Discussion:
A compromised local administrator account can provide means for an attacker to move laterally between domain systems.

With User Account Control enabled, filtering the privileged token for built-in administrator accounts will prevent the elevated privileges of these accounts from being used over the network.
