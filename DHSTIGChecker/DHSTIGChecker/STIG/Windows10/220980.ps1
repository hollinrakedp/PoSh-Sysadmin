Rule Title: The Perform volume maintenance tasks user right must only be assigned to the Administrators group.
Severity: medium
Vuln ID: V-220980
STIG ID: WN10-UR-000145

Discussion:
Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high level capabilities.

Accounts with the "Perform volume maintenance tasks" user right can manage volume and disk configurations. They could potentially delete volumes, resulting in, data loss or a DoS.
