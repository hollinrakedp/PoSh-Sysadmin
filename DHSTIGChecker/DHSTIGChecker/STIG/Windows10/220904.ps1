Rule Title: The External Root CA certificates must be installed in the Trusted Root Store on unclassified systems.
Severity: medium
Vuln ID: V-220904
STIG ID: WN10-PK-000010

Discussion:
To ensure secure websites protected with External Certificate Authority (ECA) server certificates are properly validated, the system must trust the ECA Root CAs. The ECA root certificates will ensure the trust chain is established for server certificates issued from the External CAs. This requirement only applies to unclassified systems.


Check Content:
Verify the ECA Root CA certificates are installed on unclassified systems as Trusted Root Certification Authorities.

Run "PowerShell" as an administrator.

Execute the following command:

Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:Localmachine\root | Where Subject -Like "*ECA*" | FL Subject, Thumbprint, NotAfter

If the following certificate "Subject" and "Thumbprint" information is not displayed, this is a finding.
