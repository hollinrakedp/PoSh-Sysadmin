Rule Title: The US DoD CCEB Interoperability Root CA cross-certificates must be installed in the Untrusted Certificates Store on unclassified systems.
Severity: medium
Vuln ID: V-220906
STIG ID: WN10-PK-000020

Discussion:
To ensure users do not experience denial of service when performing certificate-based authentication to DoD websites due to the system chaining to a root other than DoD Root CAs, the US DoD CCEB Interoperability Root CA cross-certificates must be installed in the Untrusted Certificate Store. This requirement only applies to unclassified systems.


Check Content:
Verify the US DoD CCEB Interoperability Root CA cross-certificate is installed on unclassified systems as an Untrusted Certificate.

Run "PowerShell" as an administrator.

Execute the following command:

Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:Localmachine\disallowed | Where Issuer -Like "*CCEB Interoperability*" | FL Subject, Issuer, Thumbprint, NotAfter

If the following certificate "Subject", "Issuer", and "Thumbprint", information is not displayed, this is a finding. 

Subject: CN=DoD Root CA 3, OU=PKI, OU=DoD, O=U.S. Government, C=US
Issuer: CN=US DoD CCEB Interoperability Root CA 2, OU=PKI, OU=DoD, O=U.S.Government, C=US
Thumbprint: AF132AC65DE86FC4FB3FE51FD637EBA0FF0B12A9
NotAfter: 8/26/2022 9:07:50 AM

Alternately use the Certificates MMC snap-in:

Scroll to the bottom and select "Thumbprint".

If the certificate below is not listed or the value for the "Thumbprint" field is not as noted, this is a finding.

Subject: CN=DoD Root CA 3, OU=PKI, OU=DoD, O=U.S. Government, C=US
Issuer: CN=US DoD CCEB Interoperability Root CA 2, OU=PKI, OU=DoD, O=U.S.Government, C=US
