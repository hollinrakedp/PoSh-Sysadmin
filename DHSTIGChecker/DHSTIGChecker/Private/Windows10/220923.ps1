Rule Title: Caching of logon credentials must be limited.
Severity: low
Vuln ID: V-220923
STIG ID: WN10-SO-000085

Discussion:
The default Windows configuration caches the last logon credentials for users who log on interactively to a system.  This feature is provided for system availability reasons, such as the user's machine being disconnected from the network or domain controllers being unavailable.  Even though the credential cache is well-protected, if a system is attacked, an unauthorized individual may isolate the password to a domain user account using a password-cracking program and gain access to the domain.


Check Content:
This is the default configuration for this setting (10 logons to cache).

If the following registry value does not exist or is not configured as specified, this is a finding:

Registry Hive:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE 
Registry Path:  \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\

Value Name:  CachedLogonsCount

Value Type:  REG_SZ
Value:  10 (or less)

This setting only applies to domain-joined systems, however, it is configured by default on all systems.
