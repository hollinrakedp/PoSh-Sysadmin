Rule Title: Windows Update must not obtain updates from other PCs on the Internet.
Severity: low
Vuln ID: V-220835
STIG ID: WN10-CC-000206

Discussion:
Windows 10 allows Windows Update to obtain updates from additional sources instead of Microsoft. In addition to Microsoft, updates can be obtained from and sent to PCs on the local network as well as on the Internet. This is part of the Windows Update trusted process, however to minimize outside exposure, obtaining updates from or sending to systems on the Internet must be prevented.
