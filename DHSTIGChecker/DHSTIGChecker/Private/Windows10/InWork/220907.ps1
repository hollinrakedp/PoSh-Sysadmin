Rule Title: Default permissions for the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry hive must be maintained.
Severity: medium
Vuln ID: V-220907
STIG ID: WN10-RG-000005

Discussion:
The registry is integral to the function, security, and stability of the Windows system.  Changing the system's registry permissions allows the possibility of unauthorized and anonymous modification to the operating system.


Check Content:
Verify the default registry permissions for the keys note below of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive.

If any non-privileged groups such as Everyone, Users or Authenticated Users have greater than Read permission, this is a finding.

Run "Regedit".
Right click on the registry areas noted below.
Select "Permissions..." and the "Advanced" button.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY
Type - "Allow" for all
Inherited from - "None" for all

Other subkeys under the noted keys may also be sampled. There may be some instances where non-privileged groups have greater than Read permission.

Microsoft has given Read permission to the SOFTWARE and SYSTEM registry keys in later versions of Windows 10 to the following SID, this is currently not a finding.

S-1-15-3-1024-1065365936-1281604716-3511738428-1654721687-432734479-3232135806-4053264122-3456934681

If the defaults have not been changed, these are not a finding.
