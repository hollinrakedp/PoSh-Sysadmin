Rule Title: The Manage auditing and security log user right must only be assigned to the Administrators group.
Severity: medium
Vuln ID: V-220978
STIG ID: WN10-UR-000130

Discussion:
Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high level capabilities.

Accounts with the "Manage auditing and security log" user right can manage the security log and change auditing configurations. This could be used to clear evidence of tampering.


Check Content:
Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.
Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment.

If any groups or accounts other than the following are granted the "Manage auditing and security log" user right, this is a finding:

Administrators

If the organization has an "Auditors" group the assignment of this group to the user right would not be a finding.
