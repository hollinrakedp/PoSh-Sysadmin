Severity: medium
Vuln ID: V-220920
STIG ID: WN10-SO-000070

Discussion:
Unattended systems are susceptible to unauthorized use and should be locked when unattended.  The screen saver should be set at a maximum of 15 minutes and be password protected.  This protects critical and sensitive data from exposure to unauthorized personnel with physical access to the computer.
