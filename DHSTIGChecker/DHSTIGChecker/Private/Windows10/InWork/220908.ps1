Severity: medium
Vuln ID: V-220908
STIG ID: WN10-SO-000005

Discussion:
The built-in administrator account is a well-known account subject to attack.  It also provides no accountability to individual administrators on a system.  It must be disabled to prevent its use.


Check Content:
Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.
Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> Security Options.

If the value for "Accounts: Administrator account status" is not set to "Disabled", this is a finding.
