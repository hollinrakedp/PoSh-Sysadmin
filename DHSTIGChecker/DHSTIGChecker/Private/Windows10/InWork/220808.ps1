Rule Title: Wi-Fi Sense must be disabled.
Severity: medium
Vuln ID: V-220808
STIG ID: WN10-CC-000065

Discussion:
Wi-Fi Sense automatically connects the system to known hotspots and networks that contacts have shared.  It also allows the sharing of the system's known networks to contacts.  Automatically connecting to hotspots and shared networks can expose a system to unsecured or potentially malicious systems.
