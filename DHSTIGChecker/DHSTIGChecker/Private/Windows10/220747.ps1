Rule Title: Reversible password encryption must be disabled.
Severity: high
Vuln ID: V-220747
STIG ID: WN10-AC-000045

Discussion:
Storing passwords using reversible encryption is essentially the same as storing clear-text versions of the passwords. For this reason, this policy must never be enabled.


Check Content:
Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.
Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Account Policies >> Password Policy.

If the value for "Store password using reversible encryption" is not set to "Disabled", this is a finding.
